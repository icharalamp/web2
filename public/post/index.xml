      <description>I first wrote this cheat sheet for myself in September 2014, but in an effort to collate my scripting references in one place, I’m transferring it to the website here. It therefore comes with a very heavy disclaimer that this is now 3 years old and there are very possibly better ways to do this now (the new feature in R Studio for new project &amp;gt; new package seems an obvious example).</description>

      <description>R Markdown has long been a key component of my research workflow, providing a legible “lab notebook” for my daily analyses. I’ve wanted to transition my Wordpress-based website to GitHub Pages for some time, preferably using R Markdown to better integrate into my workflow. I was pretty thrilled to discover the R blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages combination. I was able to set it up in an afternoon, and I have high hopes that it will be a good system to allow me to share my research and analyses with a broader audience.</description>
