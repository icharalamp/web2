      <description>R Markdown has long been a key component of my research workflow, providing a legible “lab notebook” for my daily analyses. I’ve wanted to transition my Wordpress-based website to GitHub Pages for some time, preferably using R Markdown to better integrate into my workflow. I was pretty thrilled to discover the R blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages combination. I was able to set it up in an afternoon, and I have high hopes that it will be a good system to allow me to share my research and analyses with a broader audience.</description>
